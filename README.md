How to vibe with AI

## For Humans

**"AI writes the draft. We define the value."**

### Core Values

#### Fasten your seatbelts

Safety isn't "slow down." It's what makes full throttle possible.  
Before we go fast, we set clear boundaries and stick to them:  
Security & Privacy, Reliability, Operability, and Cost & Latency limits (SLOs).  
We don't trade safety for speed.

#### Strategic Craftsmanship

We build a codebase that's easy for both people and AI to work with.  
The code stays consistent. We save our creativity for decisions: what matters, what we trade off, and how things can fail.  
We don't spend it on clever implementation tricks.

#### Magnanimity in Engineering

We care first and foremost about delivering value.  
Whether the code comes from a person or an AI doesn't matter.  
We're willing to fix it, discard it, or accept it, as long as it leads to a better result.  
The question is always the same: is this better for users and the system?

#### Enjoy the Wave

Do not fear.  
Trust yourself.  
Stay curious.  
Enjoy learning how things work.  
Enjoy making them better.

### Human Roles

#### Problem Definer

We define what problem we are solving and why it matters.  
We define the what and the why, and let AI handle the how.

#### Context Curator

We curate project intent, working assumptions, terminology, and the reasons behind past decisions.  
We keep context current, relevant, and actionable for both humans and AI.

#### Architect

We design clear boundaries and durable structure so AI can move fast without turning speed into debt.

#### Orchestrator

We align people and AI around a single direction and style.  
We take responsibility for the work until it ships.

### Working Principles

1. **State intent explicitly**  
   We share why we're making a change before focusing on what we're changing.
2. **Demand evidence**  
   We trust what we can measure and verify, not what merely sounds confident.  
   We always ask: is this actually correct?
3. **Declare constraints upfront**  
   Performance, cost, security, and operability are not "later." They are decisions we make now.
